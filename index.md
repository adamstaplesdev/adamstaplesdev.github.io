## About Me

I am a Senior Software Enginner for Imagine Learning.

I have worked for the company since 2014 as a backend developer, primarily working in ASP.Net, WPF, and Powershell.

I have a Computer Science degree from Brigham Young University, and love to solve problems with a variety of programming languages and operating systems. I have professional experience with C# and Powershell, and have worked with Python, Node.js, and other languages both in school and for personal projects.
