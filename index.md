I am a Senior Software Enginner for Imagine Learning. I have worked for the company since 2014 as a backend developer, primarily working in ASP.Net, WPF, and Powershell. I'm currently studying for the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer exam. I have dabbled in Python, Node.js, React and Go, and would love a good excuse to work on more projects with those languages.

I have a Computer Science degree from Brigham Young University, received the Eagle Scout award from the BSA, and served a two-year Portuguese-speaking mission to Brazil for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.

You can find me in Locals communities such as [Technotive](https://technotive.locals.com) and [Lunduke](https://lunduke.locals.com). I occasionally write tech-centric articles for a blog at [Reflective Engineer](https://reflective.engineer).

I just finished reading "Anathem" by Neal Stephenson and have started reading "The Way of Kings" by Brandon Sanderson. Both are fantastic books. I'm also the proud owner of [Epona.Horse](http://epona.horse) though I have no idea what to do with that domain.
